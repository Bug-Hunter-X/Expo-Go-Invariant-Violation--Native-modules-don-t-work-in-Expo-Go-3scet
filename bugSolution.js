The solution is to refactor the code to avoid using custom native modules. This means replacing the functionality provided by the native module with equivalent functionality available through the Expo APIs or using alternative approaches that don't rely on native modules.  If the needed functionality isn't available through Expo APIs, building and testing your app using EAS Build is recommended.
